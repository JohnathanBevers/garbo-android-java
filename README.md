# Garbo
Garbo is an android app designed to help with finding the nearest trashcan at MTSU.
The goal is to be used to try and lessen the impact of littering on campus.
### Prerequisites

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
### Installing

A guide to setting up the project and getting it to run on your local machine.

First download Android Studio and clone the github repository to your PC.

    You can download github desktop to clone the repository to your desktop. If needed, it can be downloaded above.

Open the cloned project in Android Studio

    When you first launch Android Studio it will give you options to create a new project, or to open one, you will need to 
    click Open and navigate to the location where you cloned the repo.

Now double click the app folder in the android studio project you have opened.

    This will lead to you being ready to run the app, all you need now is to set up an emulator to run the app on.
    To set up an emulator, you will need to open your Android Virtual Device Manager settings on Android Studio.
    This will bring up all of your current emulators, you will need to add one and you will have to choose the type of phone
    to use. We recommend the Pixel 4 and it will be what we do all of our testing on. Once you have the Pixel 4 eumlator installed you can go back to the project
    screen and make sure that the correct device is chosen and then you can click the green arrow to run the app.
The app may take a while to load the first time around but it should load the directly up.
